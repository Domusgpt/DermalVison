- **Vertex AI Endpoints:** Deploy real trained models to Vertex AI and update Endpoint IDs in Cloud Functions.
- **RevenueCat:** Configure production products in Apple App Store Connect and Google Play Console.
- **Gemini API:** Ensure quota and billing are enabled for the production project.

### 2. Store Submission Assets
- **Screenshots:** Generate high-res screenshots for all device sizes (using the provided UI).
- **Privacy Policy:** Draft and host a compliant privacy policy (especially for Health/Medical apps).
- **Terms of Service:** Standard EULA + Medical Disclaimer.
